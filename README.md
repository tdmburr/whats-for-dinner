# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
I created an application that allowed a user to select one of four radio buttons to provide an idea of what to cook for dinner. This app included the ability to receive a random side, main dish, dessert, or an entire meal using each of the three. If a user were to dislike an option the ability to delete the presented meal would then become available.

Using my knowledge of interpolation, and HTML/CSS to manipulate a page.

Targeting all of the specific elements to match a comp using CSS was a challenge.
